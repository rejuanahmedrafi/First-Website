    <h3>Adam</h3>
    <p>Adam[a] is the name given in Genesis 1-5 to the first human.[4] Beyond its use as the name of the first man, adam is also used in the Bible as a pronoun, individually as "a human" and in a collective sense as "mankind".[4] Genesis 1 tells of God's creation of the world and its creatures, including adam, meaning humankind; in Genesis 2 God forms "Adam", this time meaning a single male human, out of "the dust of the ground", places him in the Garden of Eden, and forms a woman as his helpmate; in Genesis 3 Adam and the woman eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge and God condemns Adam to labour on the earth for his food and to return to it on his death; Genesis 4 deals with the birth of Adam's sons, and Genesis 5 lists his descendants from Seth to Noah.</p>

    <h1>Prophet</h1>
    <h3>Ibrahim</h3>
    <p>According to the Islamic faith, Abraham (Arabic: إِبْرَاهِيْمُ, romanized: ʾIbrāhīm pronounced [ʔɪbraːˈhiːm]) was a prophet and messenger[2][3] of God, and an ancestor to the Ishmaelite Arabs and Israelites.[2][4] Abraham plays a prominent role as an example of faith in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.[2] In Muslim belief, Abraham fulfilled all the commandments and trials wherein God nurtured him throughout his lifetime. As a result of his unwavering faith in God, Abraham was promised by God to be a leader to all the nations of the world.[5] The Quran extols Abraham as a model, an exemplar, obedient and not an idolater.[6] In this sense, Abraham has been described as representing "primordial man in universal surrender to the Divine Reality before its fragmentation into religions separated from each other by differences in form".[7]: 18  Muslims believe that the Kaaba in Mecca was built by Abraham and his son Ishmael as the first house of worship on earth. The Islamic holy day 'Eid ul-Adha is celebrated in commemoration of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son on God's command, as well as the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to the Kaaba.</p>

    <h1>Prophet</h1>
    <h3>Musa</h3>
    <p>In Islam, Mūsā ibn ʿImrān (Arabic: موسی ابن عمران, lit. 'Moses, son of Amram'),[1] is an important prophet and messenger of God (Allah) and is the most frequently mentioned individual in the Quran, with his name being mentioned 136 times and his life being narrated and recounted more than that of any other prophet.[2][3]

    According to the Quran, Musa was born to an Israelite family. In his childhood, he is put in a basket which flows towards Nile, and eventually Musa is discovered by Pharaoh's (Fir'awn) wife Asiya, who makes Musa as her adopted son. After reaching adulthood, Musa then resides in Midian, before departing for Egypt again to threaten the Pharaoh. During his prophethood, Musa is said to have performed numerous miracles, and is also reported to have personally talked to God, who bestows the title 'Speaker of God' (Kalīm Allāh) upon Musa. The prophet's most popular miracle is him dividing the sea, with a miraculous stick provided by God. Apart from the Quran, Musa is also described and praised in the Hadith literature as well.</p>
